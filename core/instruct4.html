<p>For each word, you will use the “z” (LEFT) and “.” (RIGHT) keys.</p>

<p>There will be two halves to this portion of the experiment.  In the first half, you will 

use the LEFT key to categorize words related to how you successfully complete 

a Spartan race and synonyms of the word important.  You will use the RIGHT 

key to categorize words that are synonyms of the word unimportant.</p>
<br><br>


<p><b>LEFT  (z)</b> = Spartan-How OR Important</p>

<p><b>RIGHT (.)</b> = Unimportant</p>
<br><br>

<p>You will first complete a practice block to make sure you have the task down.  

<p>If you are incorrect on a trial, the word "INCORRECT" will appear on the screen 

for a few seconds before moving on to the next word.  Just wait till the next word 

comes up.</p>

<p>If you take too long to answer a question, the phrase "TOO SLOW" will appear, 

reminding you that on future trials, you have to respond within 1.5 seconds.</p>

<p>To indicate you are ready to start the practice trials, press 'Start'.</p>
